Mapping files for Gemini CDMP-7000 and Mixxx

Update: 01/2019
Gemini has discontinued this model, in fact, I could'nt even find it on their website anymore.  

Mixxx is currently on stable 2.2.0, which changed quite a bit in terms of the javascript mapping file. 

I plan on attempting an updated mapping, the only draw back to these models is that the mixers where analog not midi.
